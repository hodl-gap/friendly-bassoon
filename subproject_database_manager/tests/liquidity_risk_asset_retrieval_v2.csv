지금도 마찬가지인 것 같습니다. 정말 세상에서 유동성이 말랐을까요? 글로벌 M2는 여전히 증가 중이죠. 단기자금시장에서의 문제가 전체 시장으로 확대되는 그림자 금융과 레버리지의 시대가 도래했음을 알려주는게 현 마켓 컨디션인 것 같습니다.

앞으로도 가야할 길이 쉽지 않지만, 리스크가 해소되면 또 낮아진 조달비용으로 막대한 레버리지가 들어오면 자산시장은 급등하게 되겠지요...살아남아 자산을 불리기 위해선 끊임없는 공부...그리고 일정 비중은 패시브 투자를 하는 것이 중요하지 않을까 하는 생각이 듭니다.

- 최근 달러 변동성과 인플레이션 우려에도 불구하고, 2026년 초반은 “리스크 온 재개” 가능성이 높다고 평가하며 이를 AI 투자 사이클의 Phase II 진입하게 될 것.

- 단기적으로는 정부 셧다운·QT 지속·유동성 경색이 부정적으로 작용했지만, 셧다운 종료와 TGA 감소는 곧 시장 유동성을 다시 풀어주는 요인이 될 것.

- 핵심은 글로벌 수요의 회복이며, 미국·유럽·일본·중국 모두에서 2026년 초 수요 회복 조짐이 명확해지고 있어, 경기의 하방 리스크가 완화되는 구간임. 미국은 트럼프 행정부의 현금 지급·보조금·관세 조정 등 “선거 기반 부양책”이 하위 소득층의 소득을 끌어올리며 강력한 수요 충격을 만들 것으로 예상됨.

- 고용도 AI 투자 집중으로 인해 올해 위축되었으나, 2026년에는 기업들이 다시 채용을 재개하며 월간 신규고용이 50K 이상으로 회복될 가능성이 높음.

- 유럽에서는 독일의 대규모 재정지출과 NGEU 효과가 민간투자를 자극할 것이며, 독일 성장은 내년 1.5% 수준으로 반등해 시장 심리에 중요한 전환점을 제공할 것.

- 일본은 환율발 인플레이션이 소멸하고 임금이 인구구조 변화와 함께 자연스럽게 상승하는 국면에 진입해, 민간소비 회복이 확실해질 것으로 분석. 중국은 단기적으로 구조적 문제를 갖지만, 2025~26년 지방정부 지출의 전면적 전진 배치와 5개년 계획의 사회안전망 확대가 “최소한의 성장 하한”을 지지하게 될 것으로 판단.

- 이러한 글로벌 수요 회복은 결국 2026년 상반기까지 유효한 거시적 리스크 온 환경을 형성한다고 보지만, 공급 측의 제약과 미국의 인플레 경로는 여전히 중기 리스크로 남아 있음.

- 그래도 이러한 거시 환경은 AI 투자 사이클이 단순한 “Phase I – 기술주 과열·데이터센터 인프라 랠리”를 넘어, Phase II – 수익의 확산·섹터별 생산성 전이로 넘어가는 기반이 됨.

- 최근 시장 환경은 성장주 중심의 밸류에이션 부담, 정책 불확실성, 지정학적 리스크 등으로 인해 Wall of Worry가 높아진 상태이나, 해당 리스크 요인들은 아직까지 자본시장 내부의 가격 형성 메커니즘을 훼손하는 수준에는 이르지 않았음.

- 단기 가격 조정이 발생했음에도, 유동성 공급자(LP)들과 기관 매수 주체들은 지속적으로 Market Depth를 유지하고 있으면서, 조정의 폭을 제한하는 핵심 완충 장치로 작용하고 있음.

- 특히 유동성 공급 체계가 단일 시장 구조가 아닌 복수 거래소 및 Wholesaler 체계로 분산되어 있다는 점은, 특정 세그먼트에서 발생하는 스트레스가 전체 시장으로 전이되는 속도를 늦추는 역할을 함.

- 개인, 기관, 기업(자사주), 그리고 옵션 헤지 플레이어 간의 수급 구조는 상호 균형 상태를 유지하고 있으면서, 매도 공포가 확산되는 시점에서 되돌림(Redemption Shock)을 방지하는 핵심 기반이 되고 있음.

- 특히 리테일은 조정 시마다 매수 유입을 강화하는 패턴을 반복하고 있으며, 이는 과거와 달리 개인투자자가 가격 수용자 → 가격 결정자로 전환되고 있음

- 동시에, CTA·Risk-Parity·Vol-Control 계열 시스템 자금은 변동성 상승 구간에서 익스포저를 즉각적으로 축소하되, 변동성이 안정되는 구간에서는 다시 주식 비중을 재구축하는 메커니즘을 유지하고 있으면서, “하락 시 완만한 디레버리지 → 안정 시 재레버리지”라는 가격 안정화의 사이클형 수급 구조를 형성.

- 기업 자사주 매입 역시 연말로 갈수록 강해지는 시즌성 특성을 갖고 있기에, 현물 시장에서의 저점 매수 수요를 구조적으로 보강함.

- 즉, 시장 하락 압력은 비선형적으로 약화되고, 반등 압력은 누적적으로 강화되는 형태의 수급 지형이 조성되어 있음. 이러한 수급 기반 위에서, 시장 미시구조는 매도 충격이 발생할 때 유동성이 즉각 증발하지 않도록 설계되어 있으며, 호","growth-stock valuation pressure, liquidity_providers maintain market_depth, dispersed venues slow stress transmission, retail dip-buying persists, CTA/Risk-Parity/Vol-Control de-lever on vol rise re-lever on stabilization, corporate buybacks seasonal support","market buffers prevent price-destroying liquidity evaporation, adjustment not trend-change, mechanical/structural cushions convert risk into fuel for rally, year-end rally likely supported",direct_liquidity,"{""source"": ""Citadel"", ""data_source"": """", ""asset_class"": ""equities"", ""used_data"": """", ""what_happened"": ""growth-stock valuation pressure, liquidity_providers maintain market_depth, dispersed venues slow stress transmission, retail dip-buying persists, CTA/Risk-Parity/Vol-Control de-lever on vol rise re-lever on stabilization, corporate buybacks seasonal support"", ""interpretation"": ""market buffers prevent price-destroying liquidity evaporation, adjustment not trend-change, mechanical/structural cushions convert risk into fuel for rally, year-end rally likely supported"", ""tags"": ""direct_liquidity"", ""liquidity_metrics"": [{""raw"": ""market_depth maintained"", ""normalized"": ""Market Depth"", ""value"": """", ""direction"": ""stable"", ""is_new"": true, ""suggested_category"": ""direct"", ""suggested_description"": ""Order book depth, liquidity available at best bid/ask""}, {""raw"": ""CTA/Risk-Parity/Vol-Control exposure cycles"", ""normalized"": ""Systematic Deleverage/Releverage"", ""value"": """", ""direction"": """", ""is_new"": true, ""suggested_category"": ""indirect"", ""suggested_description"": ""Rule-based strategies reducing exposure on vol spikes, rebuilding on stability""}, {""raw"": ""corporate buybacks seasonality"", ""normalized"": ""Share Buybacks Seasonality"", ""value"": """", ""direction"": ""up_year-end"", ""is_new"": true, ""suggested_category"": ""indirect"", ""suggested_description"": ""Seasonal increase in corporate repurchase activity toward year-end""}], ""metric_relationships"": [{""cause"": ""Market Depth"", ""effect"": ""limit_adjustment_magnitude"", ""mechanism"": ""available order book liquidity absorbs selling, reduces price jumps"", ""direction"": ""positive""}, {""cause"": ""Systematic Deleverage/Releverage"", ""effect"": ""temporary_supply_then_buying"", ""mechanism"": ""deleveraging adds selling during vol spikes, re-leveraging adds buy demand when vol stabilizes"", ""direction"": ""positive""}, {""cause"": ""Retail Dip-buying"", ""effect"": ""support_at_dips"", ""mechanism"": ""retail buyers increase demand on pullbacks, providing rebound support"", ""direction"": ""positive""}]}"

- 최근 시장은 매크로 불확실성과 실적 재평가 과정 속에서 일시적인 회전과 숨 고르기(shuffle)가 나타났지만, 미국 주식 시장으로의 자금 유입 구조는 여전히 건설적.

- S&P 500의 breadth은 역사적 평균 대비 여전히 좁지만, 과거 데이터상 breadth 급락 이후 1M 수익률은 중립, 3M에는 +1%, 12M에는 +10% 상승하는 경향이 확인되며 이는 구조적 취약성보다 전략적 로테이션 환경을 시사함.

- 최근 풋 수요 증가와 스큐 구조 변화는 대형 기술주 랠리에 대한 단기 차익 실현 성격의 방어적 포지션 구축으로, 시장 전반의 디레버리징이나 레버리지 축소 국면과는 거리가 있음.

- 펀드 매니저들의 Gross/Net 레버리지 수준이 여전히 상위 백분위수 구간을 유지하고 있다는 점은, 이는 심리적 조정은 있었지만 포지션 축소는 발생하지 않았음

- 더불어 Risk Appetite 지표는 단기 하락했지만 1년 평균 수준에 위치, 즉 이번 조정은 위험 회피로 전환된 시장이 아니라 ‘속도 조절’에 가까움

- 글로벌 Equity Fund Flow는 +$29bn으로 강한 순유입이 이어졌으며, 특히 미국 및 중국 본토 주식에 대한 내국인 중심 자금 유입이 두드러졌음.

- 섹터 측면에서는 기술주 dip 매수세가 시장을 다시 지지했으며, 이는 심리적 조정의 깊이를 제한한 핵심 수급 요인으로 작용.

- 한편 S&P Funding Spread가 62bp → 90bp 이상으로 상승했다는 점은 레버리지 사용 증가를 의미하나, 이는 리스크 축소가 아닌 리스크 감내 증가 상황으로 판단.

- 계절성 측면에서는 11~12월이 통계적으로 가장 강한 구간이며, 11월 첫 주가 약했을 때 연말까지 S&P 평균 +2.8%, 중앙값 +3.6% 상승한 케이스가 반복적으로 관측됨.

- S&P 500의 breadth은 역사적 평균 대비 여전히 좁지만, 과거 데이터상 breadth 급락 이후 1M 수익률은 중립, 3M에는 +1%, 12M에는 +10% 상승하는 경향이 확인되며 이는 구조적 취약성보다 전략적 로테이션 환경을 시사함.

- 최근 풋 수요 증가와 스큐 구조 변화는 대형 기술주 랠리에 대한 단기 차익 실현 성격의 방어적 포지션 구축으로, 시장 전반의 디레버리징이나 레버리지 축소 국면과는 거리가 있음.
